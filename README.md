# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model

This repository contains a machine learning project that demonstrates the use of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classification tasks. The model is built using Python and the `scikit-learn` library.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify data points into different categories using the KNN algorithm. The process includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data by handling missing values and scaling the features.
2. **Model Training**: Training a KNN model on the prepared data.
3. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using evaluation metrics such as **Accuracy** and **Confusion Matrix**.

## Features

- Data loading and exploration
- Data cleaning (handling missing values)
- Feature scaling (`StandardScaler`)
- Model training using `KNeighborsClassifier`
- Performance evaluation with **Accuracy** and **Confusion Matrix**

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
